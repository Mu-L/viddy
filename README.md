## Viddy v1.0.0 RC is available

Viddy was originally a program written in Go, but starting from version 1.0.0, it is being reimplemented in Rust. For more details, please see [the announcement](https://github.com/sachaos/viddy/issues/117). We are currently distributing a release candidate (RC) version of v1.0.0.
